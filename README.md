# cuddlecare2

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## API Key Configuration

This project requires API keys to function correctly. To ensure security, the actual API keys have been replaced with placeholders like `"YOUR_API_KEY"` in the code.

### Steps to Set Up API Keys

1. **Environment Variables**:
   - Set the required API keys as environment variables on your system.
   - Example for Dart:
     ```dart
     String apiKey = Platform.environment['API_KEY'] ?? 'YOUR_API_KEY';
     ```

2. **Configuration File**:
   - Create a file (e.g., `.env`) to store your API keys.
   - Use a library like `dotenv` to load the keys into your application.

3. **Update the Code**:
   - Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` in the code with the actual key or fetch it dynamically from the environment or configuration file.

### Important Notes

- Do not hardcode sensitive keys directly in the code.
- Ensure that files containing actual keys (e.g., `.env`) are added to `.gitignore` to prevent them from being pushed to version control.

For more details, refer to the [Flutter documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/).
